ALTERNATE_DATA_DIR_AND_LEVEL.DAT.rar
Holds %appdata%\.minecraft\data with functions used in commandblocks located in the level.dat file.
In the data\functions\exxabite and data\functions\abc there are more functions. Like tnt_up.mcfunction that makes large spirals of tnt etc.
It is all 1.12.2 because after 1.12.2 the syntax for the /setblock and /fill commands has changed.
In 1.12.2 a block is replaced by putting a box of like wood on air while replacing all with the keep from the /fill with command block.
If you want to change them to 1.12.2+ versions you need to adapt them. 
For examples see: https://github.com/HakkaTjakka/exxabites-floodfills
Its a mix of 1.12.2 functions and 1.12.2+ functions, you can use it to see the difference.
If someone comes up with a mod that can run the 1.12.2 functions (copy the code?) in 1.12.2+ versions, plz call me.
For examples of blowing up stuff with the xplosives mod see https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQxTjKzyYsHF1GLQ6ET5gUA/

For making recordings (set synchronize on, works only on local world, not on server...) timelapse use the minema mod.
For using camera use the Bauwercam mod.
For using physics bomb use the xplosives mod (server to) (Needed with the data\functions\exxabite stuff)
Server is Magma server, that uses forge server so you als can use the plugins on the server like multiverse core and portals.
(For jumping between worlds on the server with multivers portals PLUGIN.)
For usage / configuration of all those google or msg me.
When using the command blocks that recursive fill up stuff the movement gets laggy (movementcheck), because the movement is updated very slowly.
Because of all the command blocks running. If you have a mod for that to fix this, msg me. The fly.jar doesnt work there.
Tia.
